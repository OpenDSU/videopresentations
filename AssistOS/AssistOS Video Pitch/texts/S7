Thank you for reaching this point in following this pitch addressed to potential contributors and stakeholders of the decentralized brand AssistOS. Generally, a decentralized brand needs a legal organization to represent the interests of all participants who ensure the ecosystem's success. In this sense, with this video, we initiate the first step towards a crowdfunding process aimed at creating an NGO in Switzerland to govern the decentralized AssistOS brand. This NGO will have two types of members: research organizations participating in funding research projects, obtaining grants, for example from the European Union; these members will not pay any membership fee. The other type of member will consist of organizations that generate revenue from the open-source code. These members will pay a standard fee per year and will negotiate with the NGO ways in which their solutions will be promoted and participate in an auction alongside other members for positioning their offers in accessible places for end customers, adding offers in AI models trained to provide services, etc. Other possible monetization methods and ensuring the project's sustainability will be created under the governance of the NGO after incorporation.
At this moment, the beginning of 2024, we have created this video to test the idea and as a first step in a real crowdfunding project that will probably be initiated in mid-2024, after we also have a first release of AssistOS under the financing and development of Axiologic Research. In the first months of 2024, there will be no method of donation; depending on the number of followers and feedback, we will accelerate or slow down the transition to the next stages.
