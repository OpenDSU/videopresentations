Monetizing Open Source applications is usually more challenging, often boiling down to a few legitimate possibilities: the existence of functionalities that require commercial licensing, and generating revenue from support for those offering cloud hosting.

Of course, some open source application creators do it for notoriety, professional development, and glory, and they are welcome to contribute applications. It should be established from the beginning that the most visibility will be given to substantial contributors to the development of the decentralized AssistOS brand, but we will strive to offer an environment that is as inclusive and open as possible to all innovations
