As we approach the end of the first phase of the presentation, I want to summarize the advantages of OpenDSU in secure data sharing between independent companies. Firstly, we must acknowledge the insight that proposing the KeySSIs and DSU concept for data sharing is likely a very powerful tool not found in other enterprise blockchain technologies. These concepts seem to us as fundamental as the idea of a file or the RPC concept.
Advantages of sharing data through the communication of Access Keys (KeySSIs) manifest in several key areas. First, the process is secure and auditable, with blockchain technology ensuring the integrity of the original data during sharing. This approach also empowers decentralized access control and self-sovereignty, making KeySSIs particularly effective for robust data sharing across different entities. Additionally, granular access control is a significant feature, enabling specific permissions like read-only or write modes, thus offering finely-tuned data access.
In terms of scalability, this method is highly adaptable for handling large datasets and accommodating multiple users. Unlike file transfer methods or naive messaging, it utilizes pull mechanisms, meaning data is accessed as needed rather than being pushed at the point of sharing. This approach also aligns well with regulatory compliance, particularly in terms of data protection laws, as it supports proper data segregation.
From a financial perspective, sharing data through KeySSIs is cost-effective. It eliminates the need for data duplication, thereby reducing storage costs. Finally, the dynamic management aspect is noteworthy. It allows for flexible data removal, such as deleting off-chain bricks, and the rotation of cryptographic keys, all while retaining the AnchorIDs. This ensures that data management remains fluid and adaptable to changing needs or conditions.
