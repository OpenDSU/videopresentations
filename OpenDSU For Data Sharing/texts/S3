In this slide, we present the high-level approach of OpenDSU-based communication, crucial for sharing data pertaining to the states of business processes between two partners, though it can be generalized to any number of partners. The image exemplifies a generic architecture on how two entities, each with their own operational systems, leverage OpenDSU to efficiently manage and exchange data relevant to their business processes.
Initially, Partner 1 and Partner 2, utilizing systems such as SAP, begin their collaborative process, or we could say "choreography." Their respective DSU Smart Wallets/Applications act as vital intermediaries in this process, skillfully handling and preparing the data for transfer. This data is then processed, being transformed into a variety of formats including EPCIS, and wrapped in universally accepted formats like XML, PDF, and JSON. This conversion is critical to ensure seamless compatibility and uphold the integrity of data across different systems.
At the heart of this exchange is the use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), establishing a secure and verifiable link between the partners. This secure connection not only fosters reliability but also maintains the confidentiality and integrity of the shared data. The procedure further encompasses the exchange of keys and the transfer of Data Sharing Units (DSUs) between the partners, an essential step for maintaining robust access control and data security.
To guarantee the safe transit of this data, DID-based Message Queues (MQs) are utilized, ensuring data protection throughout its journey. Upon reaching its destination, the data can be used or stored in databases, while the original data from the DSU (the off-chain data) remains with the original creator. This arrangement is connected to a Blockchain Network, which provides an immutable and traceable record of all transactions and interactions involved in the data sharing.
The Blockchain Network, complemented by its nodes, strengthens the system, offering a decentralized and secure environment. This framework not only bolsters the security of the data exchange but also enhances the trust and reliability of the entire process.
We hope that now we have a clear overview of how OpenDSU enables effective data sharing and management of business process states between partners, underscoring the efficiency, security, and dependability of this advanced method of communication. In the following slides, we will go into some details on how the light messaging pull approach for data sharing works in OpenDSU-based systems.
