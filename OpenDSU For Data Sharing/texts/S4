In this diagram, we highlight the first phase of data sharing with OpenDSU, which we call "DSU-fication" of data, or sometimes "bricking" or "brick-ification" of business data. This means storing the data in encrypted bricks in the off-chain storage and anchoring those bricks in the blockchain. In the blockchain, we store anchors that have hash links to the bricks. For more details, check the OpenDSU technical presentations. The control of the DSUs is managed by the encryption keys that can be used to decrypt the encrypted bricks and by the signing keys for the anchors. OpenDSU automates both the encryption and the authentication of the data using digital signatures through a concept called Key S S Is. The Key S S Is come in "families" that start with a powerful key capable of read and write operations, which can be derived into keys with lesser power, for example, only for reading or only to prove that some data is anchored and is identifiable in a blockchain or a distributed ledger. The powerful Key S S I used to initiate the DSU is stored in the digital wallet of the entity that owns the initial version of the DSU.
