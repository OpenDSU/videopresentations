In the second part, we aim to introduce the OpenDSU-proposed architecture and specific components essential for the data-sharing approach OpenDSU proposes. The diagram presents a generic architecture for an OpenDSU application, illustrating the intricate interplay of various components integral to its functionality, each labeled from 1 to 8 for clarity.
Component 1, labeled 'System of Records,' represents the core application servers, including complex Enterprise Resource Planning systems like SAP. These serve as the primary repositories of organizational data and are crucial for maintaining business operations and records. In some cases, the DSU components are the 'master data,' but in others, the source of enterprise data remains in legacy systems.
Moving to component 2, we have the 'Off-Chain Database.' This component plays a pivotal role in storing data not recorded on the blockchain, offering a complementary data management solution that works in tandem with the blockchain infrastructure.
Component 3, 'DSU Tokenization,' involves importing data into Data Sharing Units (DSUs). This step is critical for converting organizational data into a format suitable for blockchain integration, ensuring seamless and secure data tokenization. This component can take different forms, from APIs to enterprise wallets.
Next, component 4, 'Bricks Storage or Near-Chain,' refers to the OpenDSU storage solution located close to the blockchain, giving blockchain-like properties to the anchored data. It is designed for efficient storage and retrieval of data, bridging the gap between on-chain and off-chain data environments.
Component 5, 'Cloud-Enclaves for Enterprise Key Management,' highlights the system's security aspect. It involves managing cryptographic keys in a secure cloud environment, ensuring that data access and transactions are protected and controlled.
For component 6, we have 'User or Enterprise Wallets.' This component utilizes cloud enclaves for managing digital wallets, essential for transactions and interactions within the blockchain network. This could also take the form of APIs or OpenDSU digital wallets.
Component 7 is the 'Business Intelligence Component,' an optional yet valuable component that could provide analytical capabilities. It enables the extraction of insights and intelligence from blockchain data, enhancing decision-making processes.
Finally, component 8 emphasizes the 'MQs for Communication Between Partners.' This component is essential for facilitating secure and efficient communication between different network participants. It recommends the use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and is secured with verifiable credentials, ensuring a high level of security and trust in communications.
Together, these components illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of a blockchain application network, each playing a specific role in ensuring the system's overall functionality and efficiency.
