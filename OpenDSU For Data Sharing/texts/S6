In the third phase of DSU sharing, a partner's system with access to the wallet will retrieve this shared KeySSI and can simply reconstruct the DSU using remotely stored data. The receiving partner in the data-sharing process will be able to directly use the DSU data or import it into databases. The DSU concept is constructed to allow sharing to be asynchronous, as can be observed because distributed systems generally work in an asynchronous way. The blockchain is used to ensure that the data transferred is authenticated and its integrity verified, while the actual storage of the data can remain with the partner that creates it. Even in scenarios where multiple partners are updating a common DSU, the bricks could stay on separate BDNS domains, indicating that the data remains with its creators. OpenDSU is flexible; it is possible to share off-chain data by default, by using something like IPFS or a distributed database or filesystem for storing bricks. However, in scenarios involving independent companies working together, it is not advisable from a security and data trust point of view to use a shared database, except for a full-fledged blockchain or distributed ledger.
