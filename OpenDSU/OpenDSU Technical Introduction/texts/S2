Let's simplify and clarify what OpenDSU and its main component, the DSU (Data Sharing Unit), are all about. In business blockchains where many companies are involved, sharing data is a big challenge. Storing all this data directly on the blockchain isn't a good idea because it can be slow and not private enough. That's where DSUs come in as a smart solution.
DSUs offer a different way to handle data. They use well-known security methods like symmetric encryption and private key signatures. This means they can safely store data off the main blockchain (that's called "off-chain"), but still keep a basic record on the blockchain for verification. This method is efficient and keeps data private. It's a bit like Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), but simpler and without needing complex new cryptography.
Each DSU has its own unique key for security. This key not only protects the data but also helps manage who can see or change it. You can think of a DSU as a secure box where you can store files or even some code. We'll talk more about how these boxes are efficiently organized later.
For developers, working with a DSU is like using a very lightweight version of a Docker container. But instead of running programs, it's mainly for storing and sharing data. You can even mount a DSU inside another DSU, like mounting file systems on Unix. These DSUs can be set to either just be viewed (read-only) or to allow changes (write mode). They can also act like tiny databases or ledgers, keeping track of transactions based on DSUâ€™s blockchain anchoring.
In simple terms, think of a DSU as a special kind of folder or file container that you can easily share using a key. This key not only helps in finding the actual storage of the encrypted container on the network but also controls access to it.
