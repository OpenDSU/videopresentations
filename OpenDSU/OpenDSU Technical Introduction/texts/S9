The most commonly used Key S S I  belong to the Seed S S I family of OpenDSU Keys. The Seed S S I functions similarly to a seed phrase used in Bitcoin wallets and essentially consists of a BDNS domain and a random number. It provides write access to the anchored DSU. Typically, A Seed S S I  is not shared by their owner. However, for sharing purposes, an S Read key can be derived from a Seed S S I.
The sReadSSI offers read access to the anchored DSU. The DSU is encrypted with a symmetric key that is derived from the s Read S S I. The S Z A S S I, on the other hand, provides Zero Access. Possessing an S Z A S S I implies the existence of a corresponding Seed S S I and indicates that the attached DSU has a certain number of versions.
The HashLink S S I is utilized for storing the hash of the DSU's bricks in blockchain. To understand all the cryptography and logic used to derive these keys, it is recommended to read the OpenDSU docs. In essence, an S Z A SSI is a key that identifies the DSU on the blockchain and is stored along with the HashLink S S I  in the form of "anchors". Both the Seed S S I and the S Read S S I are kept in wallets or key management systems and are never stored on the blockchain, as they provide write or read access to the DSUs, respectively. The S Read S S I is used to read the data and also can verify that it was signed by someone who controls the Seed S S I of the DSU.
