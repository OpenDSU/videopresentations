We have reached a point where we can discuss the central mechanism of how DSUs operate. In this diagram, we highlight three key conceptual elements: a runtime environment for business applications, also known as the DSU reconstruction environment, a blockchain component for on-chain storage of DSU anchors, and an off-chain data storage component in the form of bricks.
Bricks can be thought of as encrypted data, which are referenced by a digital fingerprint (known as a hash or hashlink) and cannot be used without the corresponding decryption key. This makes them safe to expose on the internet without significant security risks. The idea is that their identification is a number generated based on the content and encryption keys, making it difficult to differentiate between different hashes without information from the anchoring system. This is where anchoring in a ledger or blockchain comes in, allowing for the identification of relevant bricks. These bricks are then downloaded within applications, which can be digital wallets or even classic APIs.
OpenDSU is an SDK that can be integrated on both the server side and the client side. In summary, blockchain is used for anchoring, with an approach to minimize data leakages and maximize decentralization. This is achieved by using client-side encryption, even when the DSUs are reconstructed on servers, as those servers will require access to the appropriate Key S S I. Typically, the DSUs are reconstructed in a sandbox environment, which could be cloud or edge agents.
