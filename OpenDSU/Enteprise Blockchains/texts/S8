As we come to the end of our presentation, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you for your attention and engagement. If you've found this discussion intriguing, we encourage you to explore further or contact us for an online meeting.
If this is your first encounter with DSUs, I encourage you to explore other presentations on the OpenDSU YouTube channel or visit the opendsu.com website.
In various presentations, we explain in detail the benefits of the DSU concept in the context of the insights we have acquired from implementing enterprise blockchain at the research or production level. Currently, most blockchain solutions are centered around APIs that presuppose the existence of databases, leading to blockchain usage that often seems like an afterthought, offering minimal benefits and straying from the principle of decentralization, which is founded on digital sovereignty and efficient data segregation.
One key insight we want to share is that the concept of the Data Sharing Unit (DSU) is as fundamental as well-known notions like files, zip archives, or Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Proper decentralization requires this concept to be imagined. However, the adoption of new ideas, especially those emerging from academic research rather than major corporations, can be a gradual process.
The DSU approach differs by not relying on complex cryptography like Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Instead, it embodies the principle and benefits of ZKP but allows for an interactive approach for data sharing and traditional cryptographic methods. Traditional ZKP methods are non-interactive cryptographic protocols that, while valuable in certain contexts, are less flexible and safe than OpenDSU mechanisms. The DSU concept, with its granular access control, proves to be more adaptable and effective for enterprise blockchain applications. While ZKP is proficient in validating public business logic, the critical challenge in enterprise scenarios often revolves around data sharing.
We are optimistic about the potential of these advancements to make the world a better place under the concept of digital sovereignty. Particularly in countries where the supply chain is not yet regulated by the state or in use cases where adoption is blocked by centralization, OpenDSU's way of thinking offers a more comfortable and business-friendly alternative. We are excited about the benefits of decentralization, cryptography, and digitization and are committed to realizing these in a way that is harmonious and positive for everyone involved.
Thank you once again, and we look forward to continuing this journey towards innovation and improvement together.
