Let's introduce some concepts and concerns that we categorized as layers impacting the architecture and thinking about blockchain enterprise solutions. These concepts aim to support our key insights. Throughout the PharmaLedger project, we identified five major aspects affecting blockchain platforms, best represented in a pyramid structure. Each layer holds an equal impact, but the foundational layers often have a larger influence due to their ability to significantly influence decisions in the superior layers.
The base layer is “Secure Data Sharing & Data Segregation”. These aspects are fundamental to any decentralized and multi-stakeholder platform architecture. Secure sharing ensures that sensitive data can be appropriately protected and accessible for collaboration, while proper data segregation ensures that information is segregated according to company, geographical, or jurisdictional requirements. OpenDSU provides a powerful conceptual approach through DSUs (Data Sharing Units), the BDNS (Blockchain Domain Naming System), and the naming scheme for DSUs called KeySSIs (Key Self-Sovereign Identities).
The second layer is “Data Volumes”. Built on the secure sharing and segregation of data, scalability is necessary for a platform to handle a high volume of transactions and interactions across multiple independent but interoperable ledgers. As it is impossible to build a single ledger that can scale with the number of transactions required by the whole industry, OpenDSU offers a scalable and interoperability solution with the DSU concept.
The third layer of our model revolves around 'Consensus & Scalability.' A well-chosen consensus mechanism is vital for scalability and flexibility, allowing for efficient management of complex business logic by favoring local or optimistic consensus over a global one. The concept of Self Validating Data (SVD), originating from the layer above, also offers a solid alternative approach for the Consensus Mechanism Layer. This offers immense potential for scalability and computational integrity, transforming how we approach these key aspects of the platform.
The fourth layer is the 'Privacy and Confidentiality' layer. This layer employs encryption, data anonymization, Decentralized Identities, and decentralized access controls to safeguard trade secrets. It builds upon and encapsulates the collective benefits of all the preceding layers. Various approaches, like anchoring mechanisms from OpenDSU + SVDs and IPFS, on-chain methods like ZKP, or even complex tweaking with enterprise databases and secrets management systems like in Hyperledger approach, can be utilized. The paramount objective is to safeguard data privacy and confidentiality without compromising the platform's comprehensive functionality. Various business and technical constraints will inevitably influence the choice of confidentiality mechanisms.
The topmost layer in our model, the Computational Integrity layer, ensures the platform's computational accuracy. Through various mechanisms, this layer certifies the validity and correctness of operations carried out within the system. The key insight from PharmaLedger is the understanding that a 'one size fits all' approach can have significant drawbacks. It underscores the need for a nuanced and balanced approach to effectively maintaining the platform's integrity. Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are a promising mechanism to enhance trust in a shared platform but should not be seen as a cure-all. Throughout the PharmaLedger project, the 'Self Validating Data' (SVD) concept ventured into pioneering territories as an alternative approach to this intricate problem. The main insight is that enterprise use cases and permissionless blockchain networks for payment-related use cases hold different risks regarding computational integrity. For enterprise use cases, a certain level of trust can be established through commercial contracts, code reviews, and offline integrity checks.
