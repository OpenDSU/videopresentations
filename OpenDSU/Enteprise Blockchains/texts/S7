The complexity of these topics limits us from delving into details in this presentation. Our aim is to make architects and business stakeholders aware of the intricacies of blockchain enterprise solutions and to promote OpenDSU. This technical presentation would require a detailed examination of each subject, demanding hours of attention.
The PharmaLedger research highlights the need for enterprise blockchain applications to move beyond pure on-chain approaches, such as solely using smart contracts with or without Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), for computational integrity. We demonstrated the potential of Micro-ledgers and Nano-ledgers in providing adequate integrity protection and traceability without compromising scalability, performance, or confidentiality. We've summarized four types of use cases: Data Anchoring or NFT-like models, decentralized business process modeling ('decentralized choreographies'), network-wide governance systems ('trustless choreographies'), and conventional applications like cryptocurrencies or DeFi protocols.
We identify three key architectural dimensions: stakeholders (considering the number of participants and data ownership), minimal privacy measures (such as encrypted peer-to-peer messaging with cryptographic keys), and methods to deter undesirable behaviors (like spam attacks), noting these may not suit all use cases. Formal agreements between participants are also crucial for clear interaction frameworks.
Our diagram proposes different solutions for each use case category. For Data Anchoring, Nano-Ledgers like those in DSU anchoring are adequate. For decentralized modeling, Micro-Ledgers like SVDs combined with DSUs are optimal. Classical smart contracts fit best with conventional applications, while a combination of Micro-Ledgers or Nano-Ledgers with ZKP-supported smart contracts is ideal for network-wide governance systems. This suggests a diversified approach, leveraging various blockchain technologies as per specific use case requirements.
The aim of this presentation is to shed light on the nuances of blockchain enterprise architecture and position OpenDSU as a viable alternative to custom solutions. OpenDSU standardizes reusable concepts and components, simplifying the implementation of proper decentralization. We recognize the complexity that businesses may or may not be willing to acknowledge, but note that neglecting security by design and confidentiality can have serious repercussions, affecting companies and potentially society, especially in large industries. Therefore, discussing decentralization, despite its complexity, is crucial in an age increasingly reliant on digital solutions.
