The main insight we wish to convey is the absence of a universal and solution for all problems.  OpenDSU offers complex solutions beyond basic on-chain approaches, addressing a range of emerging issues. We encourage those interested to explore the OpenDSU YouTube channel and visit opendsu.com. OpenDSU introduces a variety of concepts such as DSUs, Enclaves (HSMs), the use of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and the notion of micro-ledgers with Self-Validating Data (SVD), each having its unique strengths and applications.
A secondary insight addresses limitations in Hyperledger Fabric Channels, Private Data Collections, and DIDs with ZKP. For a detailed discussion, feel free to reach out to us. Notably, DIDs implemented using BDNS emerged from our collaboration with the W3C DID community, which has struggled to promote its standards. We advocate for the development of practical, impactful applications as the best way to establish effective standards.
Our third insight focuses on the need for evolved thinking in wallet and key management. Misunderstandings and resistance to change are common in this area. OpenDSUâ€™s approach to portable wallets, offering digital sovereignty to users, challenges traditional practices. Further discussions on key management practices will be available on our YouTube channel.
The fourth key insight revolves around Data Sharing & Segregation. OpenDSU's DSUs, BDNS, and KeySSIs provide a unique and advanced approach, unmatched by current technologies.
For those interested in architecture or research, our fifth insight discusses the feasibility of using multiple ledgers in parallel and the innovative concepts of nano-ledgers and micro-ledgers in conjunction with Self-Validating Data.
Another non-technical insight concerns the impact of existing standardization efforts, which may hinder innovation. For instance, the PCIS standard by GS1 poses challenges due to potential conflicts with the decentralized security model and the EPCIS Capture and Query Interface. A potential solution involves storing a Digital Twin in DSUs. However, aligning this with the EPCIS standard and integrating appropriate cryptography is complex. Initially, creating a web interface fully compatible with EPCIS might be impractical. Instead, we will develop an interface tailored to the new system's needs and limitations, with plans to enhance compatibility and interoperability in collaboration with GS1.
In our continued discussion on Computational Integrity & Privacy/Confidentiality, we will explain how diverse technologies like DSUs, OpenDSU Enclaves, and others suit different use cases, underscoring our belief that specific technologies are needed for each use case category.
