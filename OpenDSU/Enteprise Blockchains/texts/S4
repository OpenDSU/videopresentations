A significant learning from our collaboration with PharmaLedger was the recognition of the risk-averse nature of large companies. These firms tend to prefer emulating established success patterns over pioneering innovations. While this approach is safe, it can lead to a few dominant software suppliers, stifling innovation and creating a 'winner-takes-all' scenario. Consumer lock-in and neglect of quality, pricing, and customer service can result, leading to market inefficiencies and reduced innovation.
To address these challenges, the PharmaLedger Research project aimed to create an open-source blockchain platform, similar to Linux, for blockchain use cases. The goal was to set a common standard that encourages competition and innovation, fostering a diverse ecosystem with various product variants.
OpenDSU, a central technology in PharmaLedger, facilitates secure data sharing within Digital Trust Ecosystems. It is compatible with other blockchain technologies and enhances trust and data sharing without replacing existing databases.
The experience with PharmaLedger emphasized that no single blockchain solution suits every use case. A successful platform must integrate various concepts to cater to small and large companies within the ecosystem. This includes considerations for wallets, data-sharing standardization, privacy, and the limitations of on-chain smart contracts for confidential data.
A multi-ledger strategy is essential for industry-wide scalability. The layered platform architecture addresses the complexity and diverse stakeholder requirements in a Digital Trust Ecosystem.
The analysis of existing enterprise solutions revealed heavy reliance on APIs and databases, potentially introducing centralization. OpenDSU provides an alternative approach, ensuring the blockchain serves as the source of trust with standardized APIs for data sharing, promoting interoperability.
Regarding APIs, OpenDSU introduces decentralization through the Blockchain Domain Naming System (BDNS). BDNS is crucial for achieving true data segregation and control.
While some may perceive decentralization as impractical and prefer trusted intermediaries, OpenDSU demonstrates the feasibility of decentralization. Viable solutions exist, offering improved security, data confidentiality, and the elimination of unnecessary intermediaries.
Standardization, such as the EPCIS framework, can have both advantages and disadvantages. EPCIS, a global GS1 Standard, enables shared visibility event data but relies on a centralized approach to data management, which can be limiting.
Overall, the experience with PharmaLedger underscores the importance of flexibility, diversity, and decentralization in blockchain solutions for enterprise use cases.
