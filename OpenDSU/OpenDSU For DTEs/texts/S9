The vision of OpenDSU Smart Wallets is set to redefine the landscape of digital wallets, focusing on creating a dynamic, interoperable, and portable experience. Inherently stored in Data Sharing Units (DSUs), these wallets offer a secure transactional platform and a versatile environment for managing digital assets and identities. The adaptability of OpenDSU Smart Wallets is a key feature, allowing them to be customized to the specific needs of individuals and companies. This customization is facilitated by integrating DSUs embedded as Self-Sovereign Applications (SSApps), ensuring each wallet is uniquely tailored to its user.
Furthermore, OpenDSU Smart Wallets are designed to support various devices, ranging from smartphones and wearables to browsers. This cross-device compatibility underscores their commitment to universal accessibility and user convenience. The potential of OpenDSU Smart Wallets extends beyond current applications, leading to the possibility that they might evolve into the next significant platform for digital applications.
An intriguing aspect of this evolution is the prospect of browsers transforming into wallets, a shift that would significantly enhance user experience and digital sovereignty. OpenDSU technology could be pivotal in this transformation, offering a way to implement digital sovereignty directly within browser-backed wallets. This integration would represent a significant leap forward in how users interact with digital currencies, identities, and assets, paving the way for a more integrated, secure, and user-centric digital experience.
 I invite you to check out other presentations on data sharing and technical details of OpenDSU and SSApps.
