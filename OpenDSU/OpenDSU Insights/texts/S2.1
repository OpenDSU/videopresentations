Through PharmaLedger research project, we analyzed various existing enterprise solutions. Many of these were heavily reliant on APIs and databases, which can inadvertently introduce centralization. OpenDSU provides a complementary approach to database-centric solutions, ensuring that the blockchain serves as the source of trust. It offers a method for data sharing that isn't reliant on custom business logic APIs, but rather on a generic, use case-independent set of standardized APIs. This creates a boost for potential interoperability between various use cases.
Regarding APIs, OpenDSU introduces a decentralization solution through the Blockchain Domain Naming System (BDNS). Without BDNS, achieving true data segregation and control becomes challenging and likely impractical.
We are aware that the perceived impracticality of achieving proper decentralization, and the perceived need for trusted intermediaries, might seem beneficial to some players as it could bring business to them. However, we must warn our audience that this is merely a questionable practice, not a true physical impossibility of the technology. OpenDSU demonstrates the feasibility of decentralization. Different parts of solutions can utilize different ledgers, and each company could have its own BDNS subdomain. With proper integration, access control can be decentralized. Therefore, viable solutions do exist; they simply require some effort. The benefits in terms of security and confidentiality of data, and the elimination of unnecessary and risky intermediaries, are clear.
Another important aspect is around standardization. Unfortunately, many business people seem to intuitively have a good feeling about standardization because it appears to eliminate the risk of working with innovators and unproven ideas. Let's take a concrete example and discuss the E P C I S framework, whose centralized approach to data management can be a double-edged sword. Electronic Product Code Information Services (E P C I S) is a global GS1 Standard for creating and sharing visibility event data, both within and across enterprises. This standard enables users to gain a shared view of physical or digital objects within a relevant business context.
While it standardizes supply chain data, this one-size-fits-all approach may not meet the specific needs of different industries. Key players in an ecosystem participating in the supply chain could have differing interests and incentives. Any centralization can damage these interests, slowing the adoption of supply chain use cases and leading to calls for state legislation, with its associated risks. Involving state entities as trust guarantors adds complexity and can impede business agility, leading to governmental overreach. Balancing state oversight with business autonomy is a significant challenge in this context.
