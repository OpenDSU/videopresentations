Hello! Sînică Alboaie from Axiologic Research prepared this video's script, and it is being narrated by an AI.
Welcome to our presentation on developing blockchain applications for enterprises, particularly focusing on the PharmaLedger Research project and Axiologic's collaboration with the PharmaLedger Association.
In this presentation, we'll delve into explaining the benefits of the DSU concept in the context of the insights we acquired from implementing enterprise blockchain at research or production level. Currently, most blockchain solutions are centered around APIs that presuppose the existence of databases, leading to blockchain usage that often seems like an afterthought, offering minimal benefits and straying from the principle of decentralization, which is founded on digital sovereignty and efficient data segregation.
One key insight we want to share is that the concept of the Data Sharing Unit (DSU) is as fundamental as well-known notions like files, zip archives, or Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Proper decentralization requires this or a similar concept to emerge. However, the adoption of new ideas, especially those emerging from academic research rather than major corporations, can be a gradual process.
The DSU approach differs by not relying on Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Instead, it embodies the principle of ZKP but allows for an interactive approach. Traditional ZKP methods are non-interactive cryptographic protocols that, while valuable in certain contexts, are less flexible than DSUs. The DSU concept, with its granular access control, proves to be more adaptable and effective for enterprise blockchain applications. While ZKP is proficient in validating public business logic, the critical challenge in enterprise scenarios often revolves around data sharing.
If this is your first encounter with DSUs, I encourage you to explore other presentations on the OpenDSU YouTube channel or visit the opendsu.com website.
Now, let's dive into the insights we have gleaned from the OpenDSU perspective.
