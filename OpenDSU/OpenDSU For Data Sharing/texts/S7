The DSU Anchoring, Sharing, and Usage slides together paint a comprehensive picture of the secure data sharing approach proposed by OpenDSU. The DSU Anchoring element sets the stage, showcasing the initial steps in securing and storing data. Here, data is encrypted, transformed into 'bricks,' and stored in near-chain storage, known as brick storage. A cryptographic imprint of these bricks is then anchored in the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and security.
Next, the DSU Sharing element builds upon this foundation, focusing on the distribution of data. Key S S Is, which come in various forms to allow different levels of data access, play a crucial role in this process. These keys are shared with partners and stored in wallets, enabling controlled access to the DSU. The sharing occurs through mechanisms like Message Queues (MQs), secured further by Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials.
Finally, the DSU Usage element exemplifies how data is accessed and utilized. Entities with the right Key S S I can pull the encrypted data bricks from partners and reconstruct the complete dataset. This reconstructed data can be used directly or imported into databases for various purposes, offering flexibility in data handling.
Together, these slides present the basic concepts of DSU technology, showing how each component works in unison to provide a secure, efficient, and flexible data management system. They highlight the seamless integration of encryption, blockchain technology, and controlled access, ensuring data integrity and security while catering to a wide range of data sharing and usage needs.
