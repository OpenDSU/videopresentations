The second phase of data sharing is simply authentic communication with a partner using the partner's DID. The key that allows writing in the DSU, or a derived key that only permits reading from the DSU or a part of it, is simply added to the message queue of the partner with whom the sharing is desired. The communication is authenticated using public-private key cryptography; the message is signed and encrypted by the initiating partner's DID and can only be decrypted with the private key of the partner who controls the destination DID and identifies the message queue. A Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used by default in OpenDSU implementations. The concept of DSU can exist outside of the W3C DIDs implementation offered by OpenDSU, but some concepts like BDNS allow the implementation of IDD methods that are easy to understand and use by programmers and architects.
