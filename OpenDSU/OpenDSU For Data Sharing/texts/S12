The final diagram presents an example that illustrates the lifecycle of a Data Sharing Unit (DSU) from a sharing perspective, effectively detailing the stages and decisions involved in the process.
Initially, a new DSU is created, marking the beginning of its lifecycle. This DSU, as an encapsulated unit of data, is ready to be integrated into various business processes. The first significant decision in this cycle occurs when a business process chooses to share this DSU in a read-only mode with a partner. This decision reflects a controlled sharing strategy, where the partner can view or analyze the data without the ability to alter it.
As the DSU continues through its lifecycle, another phase of the business process might opt to share the same DSU in a write mode with a different partner. This stage represents an increase in the level of trust and collaboration, granting this partner the capability to access and modify the data within the DSU.
Throughout these sharing phases, all communication is rigorously secured. Message Queues (MQs) play a vital role in this security architecture by transmitting encrypted messages. The encryption is facilitated through a key exchange mechanism between the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) of the involved partners, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and interpret the messages.
Optionally, the system can further enhance security and trust by incorporating verifiable credentials. These credentials provide additional layers of authentication and authorization, ensuring that each transaction or data exchange complies with the defined protocols and standards.
Thus, this diagram clearly outlines the progression of a DSU from its creation to various levels of data sharing, underpinned by robust security measures. It reflects the dynamic and secure nature of data management in contemporary digital ecosystems.
