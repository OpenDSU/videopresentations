The DSU concept is intricately linked with the Key S S I (Key Self-Sovereign Identity) concept. Think of a Key S S I as both an identifier and a means of accessing the DSU, akin to how a file is accessed by its name or how documents are shared using a URL. When an entity acquires the Key S S I, they gain access to the contents of the DSU. Each DSU is essentially a collection of files, functioning like a compressed archive or a network-accessible lightweight file system.
OpenDSU enhances data sharing and supports digital sovereignty through data segregation. Typically, the entity that creates data retains it in their off-chain storage, making it accessible to parties with the appropriate access key (the Key S S I). A pivotal feature for achieving data segregation is the Blockchain Domain Naming System (BDNS), enabling DSUs to be anchored or referenced across multiple blockchains or distributed ledgers while maintaining system interoperability. With the ability to utilize multiple ledgers, OpenDSU fosters truly decentralized data sharing.
Data Sharing Units (DSUs) transform how businesses collaborate, particularly where security is paramount. Moving away from traditional methods, we're now adopting Key S S Is to control and manage DSUs with varying access levels. Most businesses currently use APIs, heavily dependent on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). DSUs, however, are shared by distributing Key S S Is, and the DSUs are reconstructed over the network by the parties with access to these Key S S Is. Sharing typically occurs via asynchronous messages, but other mechanisms are possible. For example, in supply chains, information printed on packages could be a method to obtain read access to public package-related information without additional communication. If the information from the DSU's digital twin has confidentiality implications, more secure methods for transferring the relevant Key S S I should be enforced.
Therefore, DSUs are typically shared using asynchronous messages, moving away from RPC. Different parts of a business or separate businesses can share a Key S S I, collaborating in processes either centrally managed (like orchestration) or distributed among various groups (like in choreographies). Anyone with the Key S S I can contribute to the business process at their discretion, adding new information, making changes, and maintaining it all within the DSUs.
DSUs can also be conceptualized as a new kind of smart contract. Unlike traditional smart contracts that are stored directly on the blockchain, DSUs exist on a secondary layer (off-chain, layer 2) but are always anchored to the blockchain. The main blockchain (on-chain) tracks the overall state of the contract, while detailed data is kept off the blockchain. OpenDSU's use of blockchain technology aims to enhance scalability, speed, and privacy.
The discussion on access control will be further explored in subsequent parts of the presentation, but it's important to note that various mechanisms exist for providing granular access control.
