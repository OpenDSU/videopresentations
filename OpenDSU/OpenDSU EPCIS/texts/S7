In our discussion regarding write access levels to the DSUs and treating DSUs as off-chain smart contracts, we must analyze the concept of a microledger in the form of SVD (Self-Validating Data) that OpenDSU offers to groups with write access to DSU data. It's important to note that this approach introduces complexity. The mere existence of multiple groups with write access may necessitate various SVDs, each with distinct access control, thereby increasing the overall complexity. If there is a non-empty intersection of these groups, additional complexity is introduced. However, hopefully, the realities of the use cases will not lead us into such complexities, and simpler approaches remain possible.
The diagram above illustrates the potential to embed self-validating data structures within DSUs, forming a micro-ledger. This micro-ledger could contain predefined business logic, translated into a list of signed commands, each authorized by the initiator of the change. This setup requires anyone accessing the data to revalidate it by replaying the commands, trusting only those that are successfully executed. If a command lacks a valid signature or if the command sequence violates the business logic, all commands associated with that sequence will be invalidated and removed from the microledger. This process ensures data integrity and adherence to the defined business rules.
