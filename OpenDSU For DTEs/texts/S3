Digital sovereignty, a pivotal concept in today's digital landscape, revolves around who controls data. This encompasses data storage, access, usage, and management. The essence of digital sovereignty is to empower individuals, organizations, and even nations to have complete authority over their digital information.
At the forefront of this movement are self-sovereign applications, which embody the principle of user-centric control. These applications aim to be the 'Killer Applications' for the Self-Sovereign movement due to their potential to radically transform how we interact with digital services. They enable users to manage their data, leading to a new era of self-sovereign identities and full digital sovereignty. This shift is a significant step towards realizing Data Self Sovereignty, where users fully control their personal and sensitive information.
One of the most compelling domains for these applications is eHealth. Data sovereignty is paramount here, as it involves sensitive personal health information. Applying these principles in eHealth could revolutionize patient care and privacy, making it a cornerstone of the emerging Data Economy.
Another area where digital sovereignty could potentially make a substantial impact is, for example, the creation of an Email Replacement system as the backbone of the internet identity layer. By incorporating full-scale encryption, these systems can offer higher security and privacy, safeguarding communication against unauthorized access.
The OpenDSU framework is instrumental in this paradigm shift. It enhances both security and privacy in the digital space. OpenDSU ensures that data remains secure and private through its innovative Data Sharing Units. The recommended but not mandatory use of Client Side Encryption further reinforces this, providing an additional layer of security and control.
The backbone of digital sovereignty in OpenDSU is underpinned by blockchain technology and the adoption of standards like W3C decentralized identities (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. These technologies provide a decentralized and secure framework for managing digital identities and data, crucial for maintaining sovereignty in the digital realm.
In summary, the Digital Sovereignty approach aims to ensure control over data for individuals, organizations, and nations. Through technologies like OpenDSU, self-sovereign applications, and blockchain, we are stepping into an era where data privacy and security are not just ideals but practical realities.
