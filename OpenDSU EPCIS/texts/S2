At a very high level, the purpose of EPCIS, or Electronic Product Code Information Services, is to offer a GS1 standard framework for creating and sharing visibility event data both within and across different enterprises. This data enables companies to have a unified view of product movement throughout the supply chain.
Central to EPCIS is the concept of Visibility Data, which refers to the information collected and disseminated using EPCIS to enhance the tracking of goods as they progress through the supply chain. A key element in this system is the EPC (Electronic Product Code), a unique identifier for each item in the supply chain, functioning similarly to a barcode but with the capacity to hold more detailed information.
EPCIS categorizes Event Data into four primary types: Object Events, Aggregation Events, Transaction Events, and Transformation Events. These categories help log the movement and status of products at different stages in the supply chain.
Object Events record instances when items, marked by their EPCs, are noted at a specific location.
Aggregation Events track when products are grouped together or separated.
Transaction Events link EPCs to business transactions, such as a purchase order.
Transformation Events are employed when an item undergoes a state change, like the conversion of raw materials into a finished product.
The Capture and Query Interface in EPCIS is pivotal, providing standardized methods for both capturing event data and querying this information. The EPCIS Repository, a central database, stores all EPCIS event data, accessible to authorized entities.
EPCIS's widespread application in sectors such as retail, healthcare, and logistics markedly enhances efficiency, security, and transparency within supply chains. By enabling a standardized approach for tracking and sharing product information, EPCIS assists businesses in reducing errors, combating counterfeiting, and ensuring product authenticity and safety.
