We could envision potential challenges along the lines of system integration complexity, data synchronization and accuracy issues, scalability challenges, adaptation to industry specifics, blockchain complexity, regulatory compliance, cost implications, performance, and latency. However, in our current understanding, the primary challenge will likely lie in potential incompatibilities between the decentralized security model and the E P C I S Capture and Query Interface. Therefore, in the first iteration, creating a web interface that is perfectly compatible with E P C I S may not be feasible. Instead, an interface oriented towards the realities and constraints of the new system will be developed. In the second phase, efforts will be made to accommodate and possibly, through collaboration with GS1, enhance the standard to allow for real interoperability with the current standard. The need for multiple ledgers and securing the Digital Twin will involve new types of interactions that do not exist in the current E P C I S framework.
