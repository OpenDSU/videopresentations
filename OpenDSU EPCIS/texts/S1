Welcome to our presentation about the potential to build a decentralised version of EPCIS based on OpenDSU concepts.
The Data Sharing Unit (DSU) concept is as fundamental as familiar concepts like files, zip archives, or Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). However, it takes time for new ideas to become widely known, especially if they don't come from major companies promoting them but from academic research projects. To understand the power of the DSU concept, we will engage in an imaginative exercise to envision a future for the EPCIS standard that is properly decentralized to benefit from blockchain technologies in the right way. Currently, EPCIS assumes the existence of some central repositories, and all usage of blockchain looks like a forced afterthought that adds some marginal benefits but betrays the core value of decentralization that relies on digital sovereignty and proper data segregation.
The DSU solution also avoids the usage of ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proofs), while in reality, DSUs are more like a method of implementing the ZKP idea but in an interactive way.
If you are hearing about DSUs for the first time now, I invite you to check other presentations from the OpenDSU YouTube channel or visit the opendsu.com site.
Let's now explore how OpenDSU can help us build a decentralized EPCIS for supply chain enterprise blockchain use cases.
