The concept of utilizing Data Sharing Units (DSUs) as Digital Twins could represent a significant step in evolving E P C I S towards a decentralized model. This innovative approach involves encapsulating E P C I S events within Digital Twins, represented as DSUs, and anchoring them on a blockchain. This method not only maintains the core functionality of E P C I S in supply chain visibility but also enhances it with the robust security and transparency features of blockchain technology.
In this model, each DSU acts as a dynamic, digital mirror of a physical supply chain entity, constantly updated with real-time data and events. Leveraging blockchain technology, these DSUs ensure immutable record-keeping and traceability, addressing the centralization concerns inherent in the traditional E P C I S framework. The decentralized nature of this approach introduces a new level of data integrity and trust among the participating parties in the supply chain.
Furthermore, the granular access control inherent in DSUs allows for selective sharing of information. This ensures that relevant parties have access to necessary data without compromising the overall security and privacy of the supply chain information. Integrating DSUs as Digital Twins in E P C I S not only makes the system more resilient and secure but also more adaptable to the diverse and evolving needs of modern supply chains. This represents a significant advancement in utilizing blockchain technology to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency.
The implementation strategy would involve creating E P C I S Repositories, which we will call “Local E P C I S Repositories,” to signify that they will be used by a single company or associated companies where a trust relationship is acceptable. In a transparent manner, data from the Digital Twins are anchored in the blockchain and made available for controlled sharing. This will allow interoperability and integration with existing E P C I S clients and applications, as well as the security and confidentiality advantages offered by OpenDSU and blockchain technologies.
