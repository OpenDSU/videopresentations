Our decentralization proposal presents a significant challenge: data anchored in the blockchain is accessible to any network participant in terms of its existence. Therefore, access control levels require careful analysis. DSUs are encrypted by default with random keys, ensuring their anchoring does not compromise security. However, in many supply chain scenarios, specific information needs to be directly accessible to those handling the package, typically via QR codes or 2D matrices printed on them. If serialization adhered to the highest cryptographic standards, and if QR codes and 2D matrices contained sufficient entropy (i.e., long enough encryption keys), security wouldn't be an issue. Unfortunately, this ideal scenario is not always achievable as serial numbers, potentially used as entropy, may be insufficient or absent.
In such situations, additional key-sharing mechanisms, either interactive or based on pre-shared keys, become necessary. Furthermore, there are instances where certain data must be accessible to anyone, such as a patient scanning a QR code or 2D matrix on a medication package for specific supply chain information.
For registered entities within the supply chain, like intermediary companies interacting with and updating the digital twin represented by the DSU, various levels of access, including read and write permissions, are essential. Therefore, these groups must be identified early in each case analysis, and key-sharing methods need to be thoughtfully considered. While keys are often shared interactively through asynchronous messaging, as previously discussed, there are scenarios where dynamically generated keys based on previously shared secret information are more appropriate. OpenDSU supports these scenarios, but a detailed analysis is vital and should be explicitly outlined in the initial specifications.
Asynchronous messaging offers enhanced security guarantees and enables the collection of audit information about partner activities. However, it may not always be the best solution in terms of system availability. In cases where certain data must be accessible to auditors, a manageable solution is granting them read-only access to the enterprise systems of the companies.
