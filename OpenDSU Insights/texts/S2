PharmaLedger Research was a significant research project in which Axiologic played a key role. We've gained substantial experience and insights, particularly in developing blockchain solutions suitable for large corporations and their supply chains. The project's goal was to facilitate collaboration among industry leaders, forming Digital Trust Ecosystems (DTE). Our involvement over five years with major pharmaceutical companies helped transition innovative concepts from research to practical, production-level applications.
A major learning from our collaboration was understanding the risk-averse nature of large companies. Often, these firms prefer emulating established success patterns over pioneering new innovations. This approach, while safe, can lead to a few software suppliers dominating the market, potentially stifling innovation and leading to a 'winner-takes-all' scenario. In such markets, consumer lock-in becomes common, and the dominant players may neglect quality standards, competitive pricing, or customer service. This can result in market inefficiencies and a stagnation of innovation.
To address these challenges, PharmaLedger Research aimed to create an open-source blockchain platform, similar to Linux, for blockchain use cases. This approach was intended to set a common standard that encourages competition and innovation. The idea was to foster a diverse ecosystem, with different product variants developed to suit various needs.
Reflecting on PharmaLedger's architecture, it's clear that collaborative use cases require novel software development and architectural approaches. Traditional architectures, tailored to single organizations, often lack the necessary flexibility for multi-entity interoperability and shared trust.
OpenDSU, a central technology in PharmaLedger, was designed to facilitate secure data sharing within Digital Trust Ecosystems. It's compatible with other blockchain technologies and was a critical element for the project's success. This approach goes beyond just APIs and databases, offering an alternative that enhances trust and data sharing without replacing existing databases.
Our experience with PharmaLedger has shown that no single blockchain solution suits every use case. A successful platform must integrate a variety of concepts to cater to both small and large companies within the ecosystem. The project highlighted the importance of wallets, data-sharing standardization, privacy, and the unsuitability of on-chain smart contracts for confidential data.
The need for a multi-ledger strategy was clear, as it's essential for industry-wide scalability. We will explore a layered platform architecture that addresses the complexity and diverse stakeholder requirements inherent in a Digital Trust Ecosystem.
