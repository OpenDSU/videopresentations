Besides the DSU and KeySSI concepts, which we'll delve into shortly, let's begin with understanding BDNS, which stands for Blockchain Domain Naming System. The main function of BDNS is to convert meaningful human names into configurations for blockchain networks. In simple terms, just as DNS maps domain names to IP addresses, BDNS maps blockchain names to configurations. These configurations are typically endpoints for services needed to access OpenDSU subsystems. Today, we'll discuss subsystems like anchoring, "bricking", and DID-based message queues.
BDNS is essentially the DNS for OpenDSUs and could potentially even replace the traditional DNS system established in 1985. It's designed to be a hierarchical and decentralized naming system not only for blockchains and distributed ledgers but also for individual DSUs, which are like the endpoints of this hierarchical structure.
BDNS is an extension or complement to DNS, maintaining the familiar user experience for the average person. Examples of blockchain domains could include addresses like vault.company.pharmaledger or epi.company.
The domain names used in BDNS, Blockchain Domain Naming System, are essentially just strings. The ultimate goal is to develop a global resolver similar to DNS. However, for now, OpenDSU is primarily used in enterprise scenarios, like those of the PharmaLedger Association, and a global system isn't yet necessary. In summary, BDNS enables the use of multiple blockchains or ledgers within a solution, achieving decentralization by segregating where data is anchored and stored.
It's feasible to use the same physical blockchain and divide it into multiple subdomains. This approach allows for the reuse of the same blockchain infrastructure across various use cases or for enhanced security. From the perspective of off-chain data storage, BDNS domain names provide public configurations for endpoints that can serve off-chain data, which we will discuss later as the encrypted bricks concept.
In terms of infrastructure for communication through messages in a decentralized environment, BDNS names facilitate the implementation of W3C DID methods. These methods use BDNS domains in their identifiers, enabling the creation of DID methods that don't rely on centralized resolvers. This approach offers the advantages of methods like Web DID, but  decentralized and properly using distributed ledger technologies to improve security and trust.
