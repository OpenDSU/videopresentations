In the diagram, we aim to give an understanding of how BDNS domains assist in dividing various subsystems into two main categories: Confidential Data Storage (or Off-Chain Storage) and multiple Blockchains (On-Chain). We highlight four DSUs anchored in four different subdomains, yet they might still be a part of the same blockchain enterprise use case. We also point out an optional component, the Root Ledger, located in a different subdomain. This Root Ledger could facilitate something like Blockchain Anchoring, which is used to enhance security between different blockchains. Additionally, the diagram showcases the most common form of anchoring we employ, known as HASHLink Anchoring. This method connects the DSUs with various ledgers or blockchains.
As previously mentioned, the 2024 implementation of OpenDSU does not mandate a global root for BDNS, making its inclusion optional. It is showcased primarily to convey the comprehensive vision of the technology. It's important to understand the OpenDSU vision for widespread adoption, which envisions the next stage of a more secure internet. This future internet could comprise thousands, if not millions, of blockchains or ledgers.
BDNS would be instrumental in enhancing the traceability and security of data sharing across a wide range of potential use cases. In this scenario, BDNS could take on a central role in organizing these parallel blockchain networks, facilitating easy data sharing and trust transfer.
