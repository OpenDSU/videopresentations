Hello, everyone!
Welcome to our presentation about OpenDSU's innovative technical ideas.
We're excited to introduce the Data Sharing Unit (DSU) concept, which we believe is as fundamental as familiar concepts like files, zip archives, or Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
Often it takes time for new ideas to become widely known, especially if they don't come from major companies promoting them but from academic research projects.
You might be hearing about DSUs for the first time today, and we hope it becomes a valuable addition to your toolkit in building applications with heavy data sharing, with or without blockchains!
