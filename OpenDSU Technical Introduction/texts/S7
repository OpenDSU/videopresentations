A Key S S I serves a dual purpose: it is both an access token (a key) and an identifier. The term Key S S I stands for "Key Self-Sovereign Identifiers." It plays a crucial role in connecting to DSUs, as it helps in identifying and locating them, functioning much like a URI. Additionally, Key S S I is utilized for the encryption of DSUs, facilitating decentralized access control.
Beyond encryption, Key S S I is essential for validating DSUs and proving ownership. It also manages the identity and control of the DSU's anchors, particularly in the context of blockchain anchors that require zero access. Furthermore, Key S S I can be employed to implement DID (Decentralized Identifier) methods. These DID methods adhere to the specific decentralized access control rules set by OpenDSU, ensuring a secure and autonomous digital identity framework.
