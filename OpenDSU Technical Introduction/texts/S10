Now we can try to piece together all these elements step by step. The data stored in DSUs undergoes a number of updates, with each update creating a new version of the DSU. Typically, these updates are managed under the control of a wallet, though not necessarily the same wallet, especially in cases where DSUs are shared among multiple entities with write permissions. The data is transformed into bricks (a process often referred to as 'bricking' or 'brick-ification'), and the digital fingerprint of the data from these bricks is anchored in the blockchain.
