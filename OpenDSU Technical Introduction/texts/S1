Hello everyone! Welcome to our presentation about OpenDSU's innovative technical ideas. We're excited to introduce the Data Sharing Unit (DSU) concept, which we believe is as essential as familiar concepts like files, zip archives, or Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). It often takes time for new ideas to become widely known, especially if they don't have major brands promoting them with huge budgets. You might be hearing about DSUs for the first time today, and we hope it becomes a valuable addition to your toolkit.
The DSU concept is closely linked with the KeySSI concept. Imagine a KeySSI as both an identifier and a way to access the DSU, similar to how a file has a name and content. By controlling the KeySSI, you gain access to the DSU's contents, which can be a collection of files, much like in a compressed archive or a lightweight file system.
OpenDSU simplifies this process for developers. One of its key features is the Blockchain Domain Naming System (BDNS), which allows DSUs to be anchored or referenced in a blockchain or distributed ledger. With the capability to use multiple ledgers, OpenDSU paves the way for truly decentralized data sharing. We'll explore more of this exciting world during our presentation.
Using Data Sharing Units (DSUs) changes how businesses work together, especially when security is really important. We're moving away from old methods to a new way using something called KeySSIs. KeySSIs let us control and manage DSUs in different ways. Nowadays, most businesses use APIs, which rely a lot on something called Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). But, DSUs work differently.
With DSUs, we use what's called asynchronous messages instead of RPC. Different parts of a business or different businesses can share a KeySSI. They can work together in a process that's either managed centrally (like orchestration) or split among different groups (like in choreographies). Anyone who has the KeySSI can add to the business process whenever they want. They can put in new information, change stuff, and keep it all in the DSUs.
In a way, DSUs are like a new kind of smart contract. They're like contracts that aren't directly on the blockchain (off-chain) or are on a secondary layer (layer 2). The main blockchain (on-chain) keeps track of the contract's overall state, but the detailed data is kept off the blockchain. The big goal of OpenDSU in using blockchain is to make things scale better, work faster, and be more private.
