In this diagram, we summarize what we have discussed, clarifying that an anchor identified by an AnchorID  that  typically consists is an sza KeySSI. While other types of anchors are possible, they are beyond the scope of this current presentation. These anchors contain a list of HashLinks, which are chained and signed with a private key derived from the SeedSSI, or generally with the key that allows writing to the DSUs. These HashLinks point towards the brick storage system, specifically to the BrickMaps of each version of the DSUs. We hope that from this explanation, the main idea and the operational method of DSUs are now clear.
Please take a pause and stop the video to think about it if it's still not clear. In the next slides, we will just present some details about the implementation and a conclusion.
