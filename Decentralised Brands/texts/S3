In this slide, we will explore why the "Decentralized Brand" mindset is crucial and why a growing number of individuals and companies need to rapidly shift from traditional modes of existence to an openness for experimenting with new governance and collaboration methods.
In the coming years, we anticipate an evolution of the global political and social system, largely propelled by advancements in Artificial Intelligence. This evolution is directing us towards models like Universal Basic Incomes (UBIs) or, in contrast, traditional nanny states, marking a significant turning point in world development. At this juncture, the concept of 'skin in the game' becomes increasingly vital, emphasizing the necessity for accountability and direct involvement in these evolving frameworks. Unfortunately, the traditional elites in control of country politics often lack adequate 'skin in the game,' leading to systems susceptible to corruption and exploitation.
To circumvent the dystopian futures mentioned in previous slides, we advocate for localized, decentralized UBIs as more viable solutions. Creating another global monetary system, even one initially beneficial, is always at risk of corruption and misuse. We can learn from nature's model of decentralized, resilient, and diverse systems. While certain global systems might be beneficial, they must incorporate strong safeguards against malign transformations. A competitive landscape among powerful yet inherently constrained global governance systems is desirable.
Navigating governance in an AI-dominated world is undoubtedly a complex challenge that demands concerted efforts from many of us. It necessitates a thoughtful redesign of various governance and ownership layers and the establishment of multiple safety networks to provide support and ensure stability and resilience in the face of rapid changes and uncertainties.
Looking forward, our objective is to create a better future for the majority, not just in terms of economic prosperity but also focusing on inclusivity and equitable access to opportunities. Decentralized brands can play a crucial role in this, offering more opportunities for elites to contribute and oversee AI-based economic and governance systems.
Promoting an inclusive culture and society requires carefully balancing the expansion of the elite class within clearly defined limits. This approach serves two primary purposes: moderating historical development's pace and acting as a strategic deterrent to the 'Moloch Race' phenomenon. The Moloch race, resembling a game where even winning players ultimately trade their future for immediate gains only to end up losing everything, epitomizes scenarios where intense competition results in adverse outcomes for everyone involved, often at the expense of the greater good.
Many world leaders, having lost their optimism, appear more inclined to build doomsday shelters rather than actively work to stop these harmful 'Moloch Races.'
We firmly believe in the necessity of setting limits on both the speed of history and the power of elites. Proper competition between parallel systems is key to achieving this. These systems, functioning as brands, should ideally be governed by multiple individuals, especially their members, as much as possible. This approach ensures the equitable distribution of benefits among most participants, crucial in avoiding catastrophic or dystopian futures characterized by rigid social hierarchies, sustained through violence or restricted access to advancement and technology for the majority.
