In our exploration, it's also important to consider the opposing ideas. Prominently, there's the notion of "evil," defined as the act of causing violence for the sake of violence itself, a desire for domination and destruction for their sake, and the infliction of unnecessary suffering. Alongside this is the Realpolitik approach, which prioritizes pragmatic and material factors over ideological or ethical ones in political decision-making. In Realpolitik, the idea of creating demi-gods to rule society with an iron fist, if feasible, represents a postmodern view of the world. This perspective suggests that concepts of justice are socially and historically constructed and often used to support the power of certain groups over others. This approach echoes Nietzscheanism, from Friedrich Nietzsche, who criticized the traditional notion of justice as a creation of the weak to protect themselves against the strong. For Nietzsche, "justice" is often a facade for resentment and envy.
We must be aware of these competing alternatives. Still, our perspective on decentralized brands leans more towards Utilitarianism, where an action or policy is considered just if it results in the greatest good for the largest number of people. Increasing awareness among as many individuals as possible seems to justify the practical approach, as more conscious individuals will have greater influence, harmonizing both Nietzscheanism and Postmodernism while offering a defence against nihilistic or malevolent ideologies and constructs.

As humans, our grasp of reality is imperfect; most beliefs and cultural norms are approximate and serve as practical guidelines. This leads to people existing in varying mental realities, creating substantial challenges in establishing governance technologies across all societal layers. Additionally, critical questions like the purpose of life or our place in the universe often find answers beyond the scope of science. Interestingly, modern complexity theories or the simulation hypothesis propose alternative explanations for types of realities akin to those depicted in ancient religious experiences. Despite these considerations, we can contend that justice is ultimately shaped and governed by the ability to enforce. Therefore, the capability to foresee the future and the mechanisms to alter the course of a social or economic event are ways to construct realities beyond justice, fairness, contracts, and ethical or legal norms.

From this perspective, the decentralized brands approach requires setting very strict limits for organizational entities that, in the name of efficiency or other real or imagined benefits, might endanger the integrity or viability of competing decentralized brands.
When examining the nature of complex phenomena within chaos theory involving nonlinear events that can be scientifically analyzed, we find certain limits and attractor states with unpredictable long-term outcomes. These phenomena can be externally manipulated by introducing energies and forces that drastically alter their natural course. The development of technologies for the material world and social technologies like religions and methods of organizing human groups can be interpreted as external influences on most people's subjective realities. As such, it is crucial for as many of us as possible to work on raising awareness and creating space for consciousness growth to transition from a survival-focused existence to a more spiritually inclined, love-based life characterized by growth and exploration. Only then can we ensure that material power enforces a vision of widespread prosperity and beauty rather than succumbing to blind violence and evil.
